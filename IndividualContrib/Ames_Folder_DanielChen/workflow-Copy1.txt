Workflow

Data compilation:
- add new data (merger with existing dataset)
    - School districts
    - DJ Real Estate Index
    - Mortgage Rates
    - Corn price
    - Unemployment https://data.bls.gov/

- Impute missing variables
------------------------------------------
notebook 1 :
new variables (websites)
imputing missing variables
removing outliers 

log prices, taking log of variables for a normal gaussian distribution

notebook 2:
1. regression models
linear model 1 : ridge
2: lasso
(trained on all variables)

train data (divide into test and train); train data

2. tree based models
decision trees: get data (subset of important variables)
linear model 1: ridge
linear model 2: lasso

Principal Components Analysis (transforms degrees of freedom, from 200 to 9)
simple linear regession,
ridge regression

notebook 3:
predicting test data 

use each model to predict test prices 
1. equally weighted models 
2. weighted based on accuracy 

pull answer key
should have a lasso graph

------------------------------------------
Feature engineering:
- Principal Components Analysis
- Trees 

- VIF.X
forwards, bacwards testing (selection)
 AIC
 BIC

- Descriptive stats
- Boosted trees to identify factor influence
    - Compare with random variable as a benchmark

Model development:
- Linear models (CV): price and log(price) as a response variable
- Random forest, Boosted RF
- SVM

Model combination and testing
- Voting algorithm
- Test the final result

Presentation:
- Info on Ames
- Visualizations
- Shiny App
