Workflow

Data compilation:
- add new data (merger with existing dataset)
    - School districts
    - DJ Real Estate Index
    - Mortgage Rates
    - Corn price

- Impute missing variables

Feature engineering:
- Descriptive stats
- Boosted trees to identify factor influence
    - Compare with random variable as a benchmark

Model development:
- Linear models (CV): price and log(price) as a response variable
- Random forest, Boosted RF
- SVM

Model combination and testing
- Voting algorithm
- Test the final result

Presentation:
- Info on Ames
- Visualizations
- Shiny App
